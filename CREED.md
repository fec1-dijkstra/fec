# CREED

*Contributors pledge to the following codes of conduct:*

### 1. Communication

Communicating when completing a major milestone/deliverable (message/text). We will be using Slack, Zoom meeting rooms and Discord (preferable).

### 2. Decision-Making

Collaboration - when at a crossroads: everyone comes together to discuss/talk about their feelings/opinions/options and strategies and together reach a decision.

### 3. Conflict Management

Acknowledging that there is a problem, even if the problem is between two people, having the team involved is better so that there is a mediator and perhaps this problem is a team problem as well. If anything escalates, we involve the PL.

### 4. Accountability

C.A.R. as well as having daily goals and end-of-day reports.

### 5. DEI

Having an open mind and having the freedom to express opinions and being included.

### 6. Respect

No interruption when speaking and attentively listening.

### 7. Support

Reaching out when in need of help or support and without hesitation.
